    My name is <b>Claudecir Nunes</b> I am 30 years old, born in a small city of SÃ£o Paulo - BR. <br>
    Barber for over 10 years and an immense desire to discover new countries, <br>
    I ventured to move to Portugal and after a few months, <br>
    that's where I had my first contact with technology in the developer's view. <br>
    I had my first contact with computers at a very young age, <br>
    but I fell in love with the art of development just over 3 months ago and <br>
    since then I've been looking for more. <br>
    I'm currently learning about <b>HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT</b>. <br>
    This is my first project and it is still under construction and soon to be updated.
